# Easiest way to make a webpage from markdown

Author: TS, Date: 20th July 2024

<br>

I have been exploring ways to build a webpage from markdown for a while now. From copying the rendered html to Jekyll. But they are either too complicated or a pain to write and maintain.

Until recently, I came across this Github repo called [md-page](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page) by Oscar Morrison. And I am shocked by the simplicity, convenience and the flexibility it offers.

<br>

<div class="wide-image">

</div>

For those who want to start blogging or share a webpage without much hassle and digging into the world of html/css, here is a 5-min guide of how you can build a website from your markdown code.

As you may notice, this page is also made using md-page, with a little bit of customized css. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/st3nv/st3nv.github.io/blob/master/blogs/Jul-20-2024_easiest-way-md.html) for your reference.


### Step 1: Write using markdown

First, you need to write your content in markdown. Simple.

### Step 2: Create the html file

In a code editor, create a new html file named `md-page.html` and add the following code in the very beginning.

<iframe src="https://www.thiscodeworks.com/embed/669b557a02128000147b8cd4" style="width: 100%; height: 112px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Then copy paste the markdown content under the line you just added.

That's it! It's that simple. Save and open the the html file in a browser and you can see your markdown content rendered as a webpage. Here is a [demo](https://oscarmorrison.com/md-page/) by the original author and see below for a screenshot of it.

### Step 3: Add css

Although you are writing in markdown, you can still customize the style of the webpage using css. For those who have little knowledge of it, I would recommend to start with some examples online.

- [Splendor](https://github.com/st3nv/st3nv.github.io/blob/master/blogs/css/splendor.css) by John Otander, the theme I modified and used for this page.

<div class="narrow-image">

John also made many other beautiful themes that you can find [here](https://markdowncss.github.io/).

- [Github markdown dark](https://github.com/st3nv/st3nv.github.io/blob/master/blogs/css/github-markdown-dark.css) by sindresorhus, the theme I applied in many other projects. It mimics the markdown style you see on Github. It also comes with a light version.

The good thing of css is that it is very easy to understand and modify. You can build your own style by changing the color, font, size, margin, padding, etc.


### Step 4: Publish

Once you are happy with the content and style, you can publish it to your own website. For casual sharing, I highly recommend [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart). It is free and have a lot of resources online to help you set up.


### Conclusion and limitations

Of course, md-page is not perfect.

1. It does not support all the markdown syntax. For example, it does not support footnote, like this[^1]. But it is good enough for most of the cases.
2. It does not support the rendering of latex formulas like <span>$(2x+1)$</span>. But you can still use images of latex equations or use html to render them.

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are

<div class="latex">
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$
</div>
