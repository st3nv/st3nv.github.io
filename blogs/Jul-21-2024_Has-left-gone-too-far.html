# Has <mark>left</mark> gone too far? A data-driven analysis

Today's political climate is more polarized than ever. The battle between Democrats and Republicans has become a "civil war" on social media, where the left are often radicalized as "communists" and the right as "nazis". I saw a very popuar tweet the other day that said 

<blockquote>
<p>
 "The left has gone so far left that the right has become the new center".
</p>
</blockquote>

But is it true? A simple google search and you can find similar quotes floating around since early 2010s. Many of these claims are based on personal opinions and anecdotes that can hardly serve as evidence.

Can we use data to analyze the change in political spectrum over time? In this post, I will collect and process a dataset from [Urban Institude](https://www.urban.org/) in an attempt to answer this question. The Urban Institute is a US thinktank that has often been referred to as "center", "left-leaning" and "liberal" in many studies. I personally think it is a good starting point to study the center of US politics. Maybe a better title for this post should be <em>"Has the center gone too far left?"</em>.
