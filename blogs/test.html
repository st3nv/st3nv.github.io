# Easiest way to make a webpage from markdown

Author: TS, Date: 20th July 2024

<br>

I have been exploring ways to make a webpage from markdown for a while now. From simply copying the rendered html from markdown editor to using Jekyll. But they either need a lot of pre-configurations or a pain to write and maintain.

Until recently I came across this Github Repo [md-page](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page) by Oscar Morrison. And I am shocked by the simplicity, convenience and the flexibility it offers.

For those who want to start blogging or share a webpage without much hassle, here is a step by step guide of it. 

As you may notice, this page is also made using md-page, with a little bit of customized css based on the [Splendor](https://github.com/markdowncss/splendor) theme by John Otander. 

You can find the source code of this page [here](https://github.com/st3nv/st3nv.github.io/blob/master/blogs/Jul-20-2024_easiest-way-md.html).


### Step 1: Write using markdown

First, you need to write your content in markdown. Simple.

### Step 2: Create the html file

In a code editor, create a new html file named `md-page.html` and add the following code in the very beginning.

<iframe src="https://www.thiscodeworks.com/embed/669b557a02128000147b8cd4" style="width: 100%; height: 112px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Then copy paste the markdown content under the line you just added.

That's it! It's that simple. Save and open the the html file in a browser and you can see your markdown content rendered as a webpage. Here is a [demo](https://oscarmorrison.com/md-page/) by the original author and a screenshot of it.

### Step 3: Customize the css

The biggest flexibility of md-page is that you can still customize the style of your webpage by css. For those who have little knowledge of it



1. It does not support all the markdown syntax. For example, it does not support footnote, like this[^1]. But it is good enough for most of the cases.
2. It does not support the rendering of latex formulas like <span>$(2x+1)$</span>. But you can still use images of latex equations or use html to render them.

When \\(a \\ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$
