### Research and Projects

<hr>

#### Defect Detection of PV Cell Panels
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px;"><span style="font-size: 13.5px;line-height: 50%;">08/2021 – 12/2021</span></p>

-	Utilized Mask-RCNN model in TensorFlow to perform multi-category instance detection on photographed images of PV cell appearance. Achieved 90% recognition accuracy on the testing set.
-	Designed a fast-and-precise PV cell image cropping algorithm using OpenCV to enhance the model performance. Significantly reduced the difficulty of identification (Increased AP50 value by 0.1).

#### How to Effectively Stop False Rumor on Microblog    
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px;"><span style="font-size: 13.5px;line-height: 50%;">05/2020 – 02/2021</span></p>

-	Introduced a propagation model to simulate the confrontation propagation process of false rumors and official fact-checking and debunking.
-	Crawled over 10,000 tweets related to false rumor and official debunking using python to test how well the propagation model fits the real-world data.
-	Developed a machine learning model to predict the impact of false rumor tweets with/without official statements using algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost.

<p style="margin: 0 0 10px;"><span style="font-size: 13.5px; line-height: 50%;">01/2021 – 02/2021</span></p>

- Led a team of 3 that applied data enhancement algorithms to ensure that the model could accurately identify and calculate the percentage of cultivated areas in satellite images, based on a U-Net deep learning model.
- Addressed the small sample size issue using data enhancement algorithms, based on OpenCV and various Image Segmentation algorithms.
- Utilized TensorFlow to develop a U-Net convolutional neural network model for refining recognition of image data, solving the issue of complex image recognition.
