### Projects

#### Defect Detection of PV Cell Panels

08/2021 – 12/2021

-	Utilized Mask-RCNN model in TensorFlow to perform multi-category instance detection on photographed images of PV cell appearance. Achieved 90% recognition accuracy on the testing set.
-	Designed a fast-and-precise PV cell image cropping algorithm using OpenCV to enhance the model performance. Significantly reduced the difficulty of identification (Increased AP50 value by 0.1).

#### How to Effectively Stop False Rumor on Microblog                                  

05/2020 – 02/2021

-	Introduced a propagation model to simulate the confrontation propagation process of false rumors and official fact-checking and debunking.
-	Crawled over 10,000 tweets related to false rumor and official debunking using python to test how well the propagation model fits the real-world data.
-	Developed a machine learning model to predict the impact of false rumor tweets with/without official statements using algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost.
