<h3>Console</h3>

<p>Console is where R run all your codes and output the results. Let's try calculating 2+2 by typing it directly into console and hit enter.

<h3>Creating a R Script</h3>

<p>Instead of typing R code directly into the Console a better approach is to create an R script. R script is where you can write and store all your codes</p>

<p>There are other panels we haven't introduced yet. We will introduce when we need them.</p>

<h2>R Markdown</h2>

<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>

<p>Now let's try some basic syntax in R. </p>

<h3>Assigning Values to Variables</h3>

<p>Assigning values to variables is very easy. Just use the assignment operator <code>&lt;-</code> or <code>=</code>. he variable name will be on the left side of the sign you choose and the value you want to assign to the variable should be on the right side of the sign.</p>

<!-- variable1 <- 'Hello World!'
variable2 = 'HELLO WORLD!'
variable3 <- 12345

variable1
variable2
variable3 -->

<pre><code class="language-{r}">variable1 &lt;- 'Hello World!'
variable2 = 'HELLO WORLD!'
variable3 &lt;- 12345

variable1
variable2
variable3</code></pre>
